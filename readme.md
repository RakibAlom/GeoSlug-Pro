# GeoSlug Pro - Bulk URL Generator for SEO

GeoSlug Pro is a powerful **bulk URL generator** that combines **keywords** with **locations** to generate SEO-optimized, slug-based URLs. It’s perfect for local search marketing, dynamic landing pages, or programmatic SEO.

## How GeoSlug Pro Works

GeoSlug Pro is designed to create URLs based on two primary inputs: **keywords** and **locations**. The tool generates all possible combinations of these inputs, ensuring SEO-friendly results.

### Key Features:

- **Bulk Keyword and Location Combinations**: 
  - Every keyword is paired with every location, generating all combinations.
  
- **Middle Part for Customization**:
  - You can add a middle part (default is `in`) between the keyword and location (e.g., `keyword-in-location`). If you leave the middle part empty, it will default to a hyphen (`-`).
  
- **SEO Optimization**:
  - All generated URLs are automatically converted to lowercase for SEO consistency.
  
- **Clean and Simple URLs**:
  - Special characters (like `'`, `&`, `@`, `%`, etc.) are stripped out.
  - Spaces are replaced with hyphens (`-`).
  - Multiple consecutive hyphens are reduced to one.
  
### How to Use:

1. **Enter Keywords**: 
   - Type one keyword per line.
   
2. **Enter Locations**: 
   - Type one location (city or area) per line.
   
3. **Customize the Middle Part**: 
   - If desired, you can enter a middle part (e.g., `in`), or leave it empty for a hyphen.
   
4. **Enter Base URL**: 
   - Provide the initial part of your URL (e.g., `https://example.com/`).

5. **Generate URLs**: 
   - Click the **Generate URLs** button to see all the combinations.

6. **Copy the URLs**: 
   - After the URLs are generated, click **Copy** to easily export them for your SEO or marketing campaigns.

### Examples:

Here’s how the tool processes the inputs and generates clean URLs:

- **Input**: `Lawyer For Estate Law's`
  - **Output**: `lawyer-for-estate-laws`
  
- **Input**: `Divorce & Family Law`
  - **Output**: `divorce-family-law`
  
- **Input**: `Lawyer in New York` (with empty middle part)
  - **Output**: `lawyer-new-york`
